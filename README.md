# CSS-first-project
First project using CSS and HTML in the journey of MERN developer

this is the basic portfolio web pages.

my purpose behind this project is to apply the knowledge I learned about CSS. I wanted to put that new knowledge to use by building something of my own, to see how I could implement what I learned. Creating this project gave me a chance to practice the skills I gained from studying CSS & HTML. Building the project helped solidify my understanding of HTML and where different elements should be placed.

Tech-Stack used is CSS & HTML.
